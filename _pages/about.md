My name is Yuanchao Xu, a fifth-year (final year) PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University (NCSU), advised by [<font color="#0081ff">Dr. Xipeng Shen</font>](https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/xshen5/) and [<font color="#0081ff">Dr. Yan Solihin</font>](https://sites.google.com/view/arpers). I am currently working in the new [<font color="#0081ff">SystemsResearch@Google</font>](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/google-creates-new-systems-research-group) group where I am advised by [<font color="#0081ff">Dr. David E. Culler</font>](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~culler/). My research interests are in computer architecture, hardware security and systems. Before joining NCSU, I received my Master degree and Bachelor degree from Tsinghua University and Jilin University.
