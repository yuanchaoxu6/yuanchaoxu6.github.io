My name is Yuanchao Xu, a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University (NCSU), advised by [<font color="#0081ff">Dr. Xipeng Shen</font>](https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/xshen5/) and [<font color="#0081ff">Dr. Yan Solihin</font>](https://sites.google.com/view/arpers). My research interests are in computer architecture, hardware security and performance modeling. Before joining NCSU, I received my Master degree and Bachelor degree from Tsinghua University and Jilin University.
