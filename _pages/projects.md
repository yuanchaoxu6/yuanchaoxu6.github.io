* **Persistent Memory Security** <br>
The continual performance growth and increasing security demand of data center servers are critical to the nation's economic competitiveness and as a catalyst for progress in scientific endeavors. Two important data center components are the main memory, which can be fast accessed but hold data only temporarily, and storage, which keeps data persistent but suffers from slow access. Recent technology advances have brought a new type of memory, persistent memory (PM). PM resembles both memory and storage; it can host permanent data and at the same time be accessed quickly. This project proposes a new way of memory protection designed to address the important security issues facing the adoption of PM.
